# InControl
Another task management tool in development.

This is a task control software. It aims to solve my own problem that I have many things to learn every day, big or small,
and many tasks to finish. I want a place to write them down, and build a task tree for each task, so that I can plan and control
the progress.

At this Stage 1, the database model has been built, as well as the AppEnvironment class, defining the app presenting to one user. There is a hierachy of tasks and progress logs, more detail to be added into
this README file. My next goal is to implement a command-line wrapper so that one can use it in the similar style to git.
